                    new mothers and their children. I have always gone above and beyond in helping my patients

                    that results in measurable changes is the heart of my career in the United States.

                                consequences. A medical nutrition therapy would help
                                you manage and control your diabetes, and keep your
                                diet in check while making sure that you’re getting the

                                Every body type is unique. Following fad diets is
                                unhealthy and could be harmful to your body and mind.
                                What is working for someone else doesn’t necessarily
                                have to work for you as well. Don’t prevent your body
                                from consuming the right vitamins and minerals. I have
                                always believed that in order to lose weight, you have to
                                eat right, not eat less.

                                Motherhood is an amazing thing. Taking care
                                of your health and your baby’s needs requires
                                you to find the right nutritional plan for during
                                pregnancy and after giving birth. Because
                                Focusing on getting all the good stuff and
                                avoiding junk would help you create a healthy
                                life for your child, and prevent childhood
                                disease like childhood obesity.
