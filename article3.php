                                Researchers lately have noticed a connection between what we eat and how we feel. There is still no direct scientific discovery yet, but the clues cannot be ignored. Since our brains’ functionality is dependent on burning of food, researchers have noticed that the kinds of food we eat can have an impact on our brains’ structure, chemically and physiologically.
                                Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate sleep, appetite, and mood. Serotonin is produced in the gastrointestinal tract, so what we eat does not only affect our digestive system but also this neurotransmitter, which affects our receptivity to some key functions in our lives and our emotions as well.

                                    So how can we regulate our mood through food?
                                    <br> </span> <br>
                                <img src="/images/regulate.jpg" class="w-100 mt-lg-5   my-3">

                                There is no indication whatsoever that certain food can treat mental illness, depression for example, but there are researches that link food with our general daily mood. You need to be mindful of what you put in your body. A balanced diet can help to feel better. Here are tips to have a healthy mind:

                                <img src="/images/sugar.jpg" class="w-100 mt-lg-5   my-3">
                                <br><span class="italic-SemiBold">
                                    Cut down your intake of refined sugar


                                    <br> </span> <br>

                                Diets that are high in refined sugar worsen your bodies regulation of insulin,
                                and promote inflammation which can lead to stress. Links have been made between
                                refined sugar and impaired brain’s function, and the worsening of symptoms of mood disorders.
                                Refined sugars are found in white flour, corn syrup, white sugar, brown sugar, fructose,
                                and artificial sweeteners.



                                <img src="/images/carbs.jpg" class="w-100 mt-lg-5   my-3">
                                <br><span class="italic-SemiBold">

                                    Don’t eliminate carbs, but choose the healthy ones


                                    <br> </span> <br>

                                Don’t overtake processed carbs, like white flour, but choose the carbs found in its natural states like fruits, dairy products, honey, oats, and some nuts and seeds.

                                <br><span class="italic-SemiBold">
                                    Fatty Fish
                                    <br> </span> <br>


                                Fish are rich in Omega 3 fatty acids. Omega-3s contribute to the fluidity of your brain’s cell membrane and appear to play key roles in brain development and cell signaling. It makes you think clearer, and focus easily.




                                <img src="/images/breakfast.jpg" class="w-100 mt-lg-5   my-3">
                                <br><span class="italic-SemiBold">


                                    A balanced breakfast
                                    <br> </span> <br>

                                Breakfast is the wakeup call for your brain, and whatever you eat in the morning can affect the rest of
                                your day. Rely on eggs, dairies, and fruits for a healthy breakfast.

                                <img src="/images/VitaminD.jpg" class="w-100 mt-lg-5   my-3">
                                <br><span class="italic-SemiBold">
                                    Vitamin D
                                    <br> </span> <br>




                                Vitamin D deficiency can lead to fatigue, sleepiness, and muscle weakness, which can lead to stress and a bad mood. Maintain a regular intake of Vitamin D which can be found in yogurt, and a healthy dose of sunlight.

                                <img src="/images/Nuts.jpg" class="w-100 mt-lg-5   my-3">
                                <br><span class="italic-SemiBold">

                                    Nuts and Seeds

                                    <br> </span> <br>


                                Nuts are high in healthy fats, fiber, protein, and vitamins. Almond, for example, is rich in vitamin E, while sunflower seeds are rich in magnesium, phosphorus, and vitamins B and E. This gives you a boost of energy, and clear focused brain.


                                <img src="/images/caffeine.jpg" class="w-100 mt-lg-5   my-3">
                                <br><span class="italic-SemiBold">

                                    Don’t overuse caffeine!
                                    <br> </span> <br>



                                Coffee is the most popular drink in the world, and for a good reason. Coffee gives you the needed energy you may lack from inadequate sleep, as well as it has shown that it can boost your mood. But too much coffee can backfire as it can lead to insomnia which causes stress and a general bad mood.
