                        The main reason I chose to become a nutrition professional was my son Ali. Ali was
                        born with a rare metabolic disorder that doctors had little knowledge about. I
                        have always been willing to do anything to ensure his wellbeing. Since he was

                        dietitian to manage Ali’s condition. I am very thankful that I chose this

                        Nutrition has been a concern to humans for several centuries. Since
                        Hippocrates, food has been considered a “medicine” that heals the body and
                        mind and can help prevent illness.<br><br>
                        “Let <span class="bold">food</span> be thy medicine, and let medicine be thy <span class="bold">food</span>.” The Greek
                        physician Hippocrates , a famous<span class="bold"> philosopher. </span> .<br><br>
                        I enjoy making a positive impact on people’s lives. As a healthcare
                        professional and wellness advocate, I find that my field is rewarding on a daily
                        basis, not only working with clients, but also speaking with friends and family
                        about nutrition.

                    <p class=" italic-light-m col-12 " style="font-size:18px;">


                        My natural ability to organize effectively allows me to be organized and
                        always prioritize my tasks based on due dates and the length of the tasks.
                        Creating a daily list of what needs to be completed makes me work efficiently
                        which provides me with some flexibility in case of a heavy workload or
                        emergencies.

                        I love my career very much because it provides me with the opportunity to help
                        others. My way of taking topics, things, or matters to heart and dealing with every
                        aspect honestly and without sugar coating them is my greatest weakness and
                        strength at the same time. Some people like to be straight forward in their
                        communication and some others are very sensitive. This makes it imperative that I
                        choose my words very carefully with them. I have been striving to improve this area
                        and from my surrounding feedback, I see that I am succeeding.

                        I have always believed that good nutrition begins with the good health status
                        of a mother prior to conception and it carries on throughout pregnancy and
                        after delivery. Well-nourished mothers have a great possibility of giving birth
                        to a healthy nourished infant. Therefore, I specialized in Pediatric Nutrition
                        where I learned in depth all about motherhood, infancy, childhood, and
                        teenage nutrition. In addition, I was very interested in learning about
                        breastfeeding, where breastmilk is the liquid gold nutrition for our babies, so I
                        became an expert in this area too.

                        My future plans are evolving every few years. Whenever I achieve some of
                        my goals, I evaluate my values, skills, needs and available options and make
                        new plans with new goals. Currently, my new goal is to spread the knowledge
                        to the world and prevent obesity because obesity is expected to contribute to
                        millions of cases of preventable chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes,
                        heart disease and cancer.

                        Like a lot of people, I like to drink my cup of coffee in the morning, prepare my
                        breakfast and lunch and leave to work. Since my job requires a lot of sitting at
                        my office. I wear my fit bit every morning to track my steps, so I can reach my
                        goal by the end of the day. In the afternoon, I try to stay active by going to
                        gym or walking in my neighborhood.

                        Life is full of challenges and many of them are difficult to overcome. To cope
                        with stress, I try to take care of myself first by getting enough rest, eating
                        healthy, sleeping well and exercising regularly. I start with a single step and
                        focus on the positive side of any issue. </p>

                        I would not call them “worst fears”, I would call them most challenging aspects
                        in the nutrition profession. There are a huge amount of myths and inaccurate
                        information spreading all over social media. Some people believe messages
                        or advices about food and new fad diets which may not be entirely accurate,
                        putting themselves at risk and harming their health. It is extremely difficult for
                        a nutritionist or any health care professional to provide logical consistent
                        information about adopting a healthy lifestyle in a misleading environment. </p>

                        I have always believed that good nutrition begins with the good health status
                        of a mother prior to conception and it carries on throughout pregnancy and
                        after delivery. Well-nourished mothers have a great possibility of giving birth
                        to a healthy nourished infant. Therefore, I specialized in Pediatric Nutrition
                        where I learned in depth all about motherhood, infancy, childhood, and
                        teenage nutrition. In addition, I was very interested in learning about
                        breastfeeding, where breastmilk is the liquid gold nutrition for our babies, so I
                        became an expert in this area too.

                        Nutrition has been a concern to humans for several centuries. Since
                        Hippocrates, food has been considered a “medicine” that heals the body and
                        mind and can help prevent illness.<br><br>
                        “Let <span class="bold">food</span> be thy medicine, and let medicine be thy <span class="bold">food</span>.” The Greek
                        physician Hippocrates , a famous<span class="bold"> philosopher. </span> .<br><br>
                        I enjoy making a positive impact on people’s lives. As a healthcare
                        professional and wellness advocate, I find my field is rewarding on a daily
                        basis, not only working with clients, but also speaking with friends and family
                        about nutrition.

                        My future plans are evolving every few years. Whenever I achieve some of
                        my goals, I evaluate my values, skills, needs and available options and make
                        new plans with new goals. Currently, my new goal is to spread the knowledge
                        to the world and prevent obesity because obesity is expected to contribute to
                        millions of cases of preventable chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes,
                        heart disease and cancer.

                        My natural ability to organize effectively allows me to be organized and
                        always prioritize my tasks based on due dates and the length of the tasks.
                        Creating a daily list of what needs to be completed makes me work efficiently
                        which provides me with some flexibility in case of a heavy workload or
                        emergencies.

                        Like a lot of people, I like to drink my cup of coffee in the morning, prepare my
                        breakfast and lunch and leave to work. Since my job requires a lot of sitting at
                        my office. I wear my fit bit every morning to track my steps, so I can reach my
                        goal by the end of the day. In the afternoon, I try to stay active by going to
                        gym or walking in my neighborhood.

                        I love my career very much because it provides me with the opportunity to help
                        others. My way of taking topics, things, or matters to heart and dealing with every
                        aspect honestly and without sugar coating them is my greatest weakness and
                        strength at the same time. Some people like to be straight forward in their
                        communication and some others are very sensitive. This makes it imperative that I
                        choose my words very carefully with them. I have been striving to improve this area
                        and from my surrounding feedback, I see that I am succeeding.

                        Life is full of challenges and many of them are difficult to overcome. To cope
                        with stress, I try to take care of myself first by getting enough rest, eating
                        healthy, sleeping well and exercising regularly. I start with a single step and
                        focus on the positive side of any issue. </p>

                        I am a very caring person and I take the extra step to help my clients to set
                        their goals, educate them on healthy eating habits, provide them with the
                        information and tools needed, follow up with them and make sure that they
                        are on the right track towards achieving their goal.

                        I would not call them “worst fears”, I would call them most challenging aspects
                        in the nutrition profession. There are a huge amount of myths and inaccurate
                        information spreading all over social media. Some people believe messages
                        or advices about food and new fad diets which may not be entirely accurate,
                        putting themselves at risk and harming their health. It is extremely difficult for
                        a nutritionist or any health care professional to provide logical consistent
                        information about adopting a healthy lifestyle in a misleading environment. </p>
