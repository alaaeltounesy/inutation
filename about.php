                            The main reason I chose to become a nutrition professional was my son Ali. Ali was born with a rare metabolic disorder that doctors had little knowledge of; I have always been willing to do anything to ensure his well-being. Since he was young, I have been working with a team consisting of several doctors and a dietitian to manage Ali’s condition. I am very thankful that I chose this field and was able to make a positive impact on his life.

                            Nutrition has been a concern to humans for several centuries. Since Hippocrates, food has been considered a “medicine” that heals the body and mind and can help prevent illness.


                            <br><br>


                            “Let <span class="bold">food</span> be thy medicine, and let medicine be thy <span class="bold">food</span>.”
                            The Greek physician Hippocrates, a famous <span class="bold"> philosopher. </span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I enjoy making a positive impact on people’s lives. As a healthcare professional and wellness advocate, I find that my field is rewarding daily, not only working with clients but also speaking with friends and family about nutrition.

                            My natural ability to organize effectively allows me to organize and always prioritize my tasks based on due dates and the length of the tasks. Creating a daily list of what needs to be completed makes me work efficiently, which provides me with some flexibility in case of a heavy workload or emergencies.

                            I love my career very much because it provides me with the opportunity to help others. My way of taking topics, things, or matters to heart and dealing with every aspect honestly and without sugar-coating them is my greatest weakness and strength at the same time. Some people like to be straightforward in their communication, and some others are sensitive. That makes it imperative that I choose my words very carefully with them. I have been striving to improve this area, and from my surrounding feedback, I see that I am succeeding.

                        <p class=" italic-light-m col-12 " style="font-size:18px;">



                            I have always believed that good nutrition begins with a good health status of a mother before conception, and it carries on throughout pregnancy and after delivery. Well-nourished mothers have a great possibility of giving birth to a healthy, nourished infant. Therefore, I specialized in Pediatric Nutrition, where I learned in depth all about motherhood, infancy, childhood, and teenage nutrition. Also, I was very interested in learning about breastfeeding, where breastmilk is the liquid gold nutrition for our babies, so I became an expert in this area too.
                        </p>

                        <p class=" italic-light-m col-12 " style="font-size:18px;">



                            My plans are evolving every few years. Whenever I achieve some of my goals, I evaluate my values, skills, needs, and available options and make new plans with new goals. Currently, my new goal is to spread the knowledge to the world and prevent obesity because obesity is expected to contribute to millions of cases of preventable chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

                            Like a lot of people, I like to drink my cup of coffee in the morning, prepare my breakfast and lunch and leave to work. Since my job requires a lot of sitting at my office, I wear my fit bit every morning to track my steps. So, I can reach my goal by the end of the day. In the afternoon, I try to stay active by going to the gym or walking in my neighborhood.

                        <p class=" italic-light-m col-12 " style="font-size:18px;">


                            Life is full of challenges, and many of them are difficult to overcome. To cope with stress, I try to take care of myself first by getting enough rest, eating healthy, sleeping well, and exercising regularly. I start with a single step and focus on the positive side of any issue. </p>


                    </div>

                        <p class=" italic-light-m col-12 " style="font-size:18px;">


                            I would not call them “worst fears” I would call them the most challenging aspects in the nutrition profession. Several myths and inaccurate information are spreading all over social media. Some people believe messages or advice about food and new fad diets which may not be entirely accurate, putting themselves at risk and harming their health. It is difficult for a nutritionist or any health care professional to provide logical and consistent information about adopting a healthy lifestyle in a misleading environment. </p>

                            Nutrition has been a concern to humans for several centuries. Since Hippocrates, food has been considered a “medicine” that heals the body and mind and can help prevent illness.


                            <br><br>


                            “Let <span class="bold">food</span> be thy medicine, and let medicine be thy <span class="bold">food</span>.”
                            The Greek physician Hippocrates, a famous <span class="bold"> philosopher. </span>

                            <br>
                            I enjoy making a positive impact on people’s lives. As a healthcare professional and wellness advocate, I find that my field is rewarding daily, not only working with clients but also speaking with friends and family about nutrition.

                            My plans are evolving every few years. Whenever I achieve some of my goals, I evaluate my values, skills, needs, and available options and make new plans with new goals. Currently, my new goal is to spread the knowledge to the world and prevent obesity because obesity is expected to contribute to millions of cases of preventable chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

                            My natural ability to organize effectively allows me to organize and always prioritize my tasks based on due dates and the length of the tasks. Creating a daily list of what needs to be completed makes me work efficiently, which provides me with some flexibility in case of a heavy workload or emergencies.

                            Like a lot of people, I like to drink my cup of coffee in the morning, prepare my breakfast and lunch and leave to work. Since my job requires a lot of sitting at my office, I wear my fit bit every morning to track my steps. So, I can reach my goal by the end of the day. In the afternoon, I try to stay active by going to the gym or walking in my neighborhood.

                            I love my career very much because it provides me with the opportunity to help others. My way of taking topics, things, or matters to heart and dealing with every aspect honestly and without sugar-coating them is my greatest weakness and strength at the same time. Some people like to be straightforward in their communication, and some others are sensitive. That makes it imperative that I choose my words very carefully with them. I have been striving to improve this area, and from my surrounding feedback, I see that I am succeeding.

                            Life is full of challenges, and many of them are difficult to overcome. To cope with stress,
                            I try to take care of myself first by getting enough rest, eating healthy, sleeping well,
                            and exercising regularly. I start with a single step and focus on the positive side of any issue. </p>

                            I am a very caring person, and I take the extra step to help my clients to set their goals, educate them on healthy eating habits, provide them with the information and tools needed, follow up with them and make sure that they are on the right track towards achieving their goal.

                            I would not call them “worst fears” I would call them the most challenging aspects in the nutrition profession. Several myths and inaccurate information are spreading all over social media. Some people believe messages or advice about food and new fad diets which may not be entirely accurate, putting themselves at risk and harming their health. It is difficult for a nutritionist or any health care professional to provide logical and consistent information about adopting a healthy lifestyle in a misleading environment. </p>
