                            The main reason I chose to become a nutrition professional was my son, Ali. Ali was born with a rare metabolic disorder that doctors had little knowledge of; due to my experience with this healthcare team, I recognized that nutrition was an essential part of every person’s life. That motivated me to enroll in the Florida International University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science. But I didn’t stop there. I went on to acquire a master’s degree in Dietetics and Nutrition from Florida International University in Miami, FL. </h5>

                                    Everybody type is unique. Following fad diets is unhealthy and could be harmful to your body and mind. What is working for someone else doesn’t necessarily have to work for you as well. Don’t prevent your body from consuming the right vitamins and minerals. I have always believed that to lose weight, you have to eat right, not eat less.

                                    Motherhood is amazing. Taking care of your health and your baby’s needs requires you to find the right nutritional plan during pregnancy and after giving birth. Because Focusing on getting all the good stuff and avoiding junk would help you create a healthy life for your child, and prevent childhood diseases like childhood obesity.

                                    We are indeed much more than what we eat, but what we eat can nevertheless help us to be much more than what we are.” I have always believed that nothing is impossible. If you believe in yourself, put in the effort, and work towards achieving your goal, you will succeed. Living the happy, healthy, and comfortable life you want for you and your family requires you to understand that the right nutrition is your way to achieving that.

                                    During breastfeeding, the types of food you eat affect both you and your baby. Motherhood is caring for your baby, and yourself and I can provide you with the perfect plan, so you can stay healthy and be able to keep your baby healthy.

                                    It is hard to find the perfect plan for your body to stay healthy. My strategy is to create a specific plan for you. Each body is different, and it needs a unique way to care for it. Don’t let random meal plans harm your body. I can help you make the perfect plan for you to keep you healthy and fit.
