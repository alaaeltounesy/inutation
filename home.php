                            The main reason I chose to become a nutrition professional was my son, Ali. Ali was born with a rare metabolic disorder that doctors had little knowledge about. From my experience with this healthcare team,
                            I recognized that nutrition was the most essential part in every person’s life. This motivated me to enroll in the Florida International University where I earned a Bachelor of Science. But I didn’t stop there. I went on to acquire a master’s degree in Dietetics and Nutrition from Florida International University in Miami, FL.

                                    Every body type is unique. Following fad diets is
                                    unhealthy and could be harmful to your body and mind.
                                    What is working for someone else doesn’t necessarily
                                    have to work for you as well. Don’t prevent your body
                                    from consuming the right vitamins and minerals. I have
                                    always believed that in order to lose weight, you have to
                                    eat right, not eat less.

                                    Motherhood is an amazing thing. Taking care
                                    of your health and your baby’s needs requires
                                    you to find the right nutritional plan for during
                                    pregnancy and after giving birth. Because
                                    Focusing on getting all the good stuff and
                                    avoiding junk would help you create a healthy
                                    life for your child, and prevent childhood
                                    disease like childhood obesity.

                                    While breastfeeding, the types of food you eat affect both you and your baby. Motherhood is caring for your baby, and yourself and I can provide you with the perfect plan for you so you can stay healthy, and be able to keep your baby healthy.

                                    It is hard to find the perfect plan for your body to stay healthy. My strategy is to create a specific plan for you. Each body is different, and it needs a different strategy to care for it. Don’t let random meal plans harm your body. I can help you make the perfect plan for you to keep you healthy and fit.
